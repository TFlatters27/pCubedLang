## Introduction

This project is a custom programming language designed to closely follow the AQA pseudocode specification, implemented in C. It is designed for those who are familiar with AQA pseudocode and want a practical way to execute their pseudocode programs.

## Features

- **Syntax**: Follows the AQA pseudocode structure closely, making it easy to transition from pseudocode to an executable format.
- **Performance**: Implemented in C for efficient execution.
- **Educational Use**: Ideal for students preparing for exams or educators demonstrating AQA pseudocode concepts.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages based on common pseudocode mistakes.
  
## Installation

To install and run the language on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) installed. On most Linux distributions, you can install `gcc` using:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install build-essential  # For Ubuntu/Debian
    ```

    Or for macOS:

    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```

2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mxcury/pCubedLang.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd pCubedLang
    ```

4. Compile the source code using `make`:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

5. Install the executable:

    ```bash
    sudo make install
    ```

6. Run the `p3` executable:

    ```bash
    p3
    ```

7. (Optional) To uninstall the program:

    ```bash
    sudo make uninstall
    ```

After following these steps, you'll have the `p3` interpreter installed and ready to run your pseudocode programs.

## Usage

Once the interpreter is compiled and installed, you can write your pseudocode programs in a `.p3` file and run them using the `p3` executable:

```bash
p3 <yourfile.p3>
```

Example:

```bash
p3 hello_world.p3
```

### Debug Mode

To see the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) produced during execution and how long the program took to run, use the `--debug` flag:

```bash
p3 --debug <yourfile.p3>
```

This will output additional information, including the AST structure and execution time.

```bash
p3 --debug hello_world.p3
```

This command will:

- Compile and run `hello_world.p3`.
- Output the AST generated by the parser.
- Display how long it took to run the program.

## Syntax Overview

The language follows AQA pseudocode conventions, which include the following key elements:

- **Variables**: Declared using `DECLARE` followed by the variable name and type.

    ```pseudo
    count <- 0
    ```

- **Input/Output**: Supports `OUTPUT`, `USERINPUT`, etc.

    ```pseudo
    OUTPUT "Enter a number"
    number <- USERINPUT
    ```

- **Control Flow**: Includes `IF`, `ELSE`, `WHILE`, `FOR`, and other standard constructs.

    ```pseudo
    IF number > 0 THEN
        OUTPUT "Positive"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "Negative"
    ENDIF
    ```

- **Loops**: Supports `FOR`, `WHILE`, and `REPEAT...UNTIL` loops.

    ```pseudo
    FOR i <- 1 TO 10
        OUTPUT i
    ENDFOR
    ```

## Examples

Here are some examples to demonstrate the language in action:

1. **Hello World**

    ```pseudo
    OUTPUT "Hello, World!"
    ```

2. **Sum of Numbers**

    ```pseudo
    sum <- 0
    FOR i <- 1 TO 10
        sum <- sum + i
    ENDFOR
    OUTPUT sum
    ```

3. **Simple IF Statement**

    ```pseudo
    OUTPUT "Enter a number:"
    num <- USERINPUT
    num <- STRING_TO_INT(num)
    IF num > 0 THEN
        OUTPUT "Positive"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "Negative or Zero"
    ENDIF
    ```
